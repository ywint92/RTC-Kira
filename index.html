    <p>Computer Science is one of my favorite subject to learn about in school based on learning more about coding
        and what's important about computer science. Getting comfortable with coding and making different projects
        takes me a while to really get it and to really understand then others sometimes i have negitve thoughts
        is computer science really for me.
        Knowing and growing up on how how to fix computers, Knowing how to design a website is a learning experiance
        and taking that same skills that you lean in school will make you a better developer
